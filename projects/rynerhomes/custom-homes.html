			<h3>Custom Homes</h3>
			<p>
				For more than two decades, Ryner Homes based in Snohomish, Washington, has built custom homes for people throughout 
				the area. Trust our custom home professionals to give you the home of your dreams.
			</p>
			<h4>Building Homes</h4>
			<p>
				Ryner Homes has been building northwest custom homes for more than 20 years in Snohomish and North King Counties.
				We've built and mastered our approach in the process.
			</p>
			<h4>Count on Us</h4>
			<p>
				Count on us to stay on schedule, while adhering to the best practices developed and proven over time. Also count on
				us to be around for decades to come, and to stand by the reputation we've carefully built.
			</p>
			<h4>What to Expect</h4>
			<p>
				Timeless artistry and meticulous workmanship, exceptional attention to detail and proportion, distinctive mill work 
				and luxurious amenities—these are the qualities you've come to expect from Ryner Homes time and again. Ryner Homes’ 
				homeowners tell us that the major attribute that drew them to our company is the integrity of the experience.
			</p>
			<p>
				We design and build every home to offer a seamless union of tradition, character, and sophistication. From our use of 
				top-of-the-line materials to the quality of craftsmanship that goes into every detail and every room, this is the home 
				that will continue to reward you in comfort and style. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Your Ryner Homes home is also an investment that will pay you back as you enjoy living in a spacious, luxurious home 
				now—and again if you resell it later.
			</p>
			<h4>Energy-Efficient/Green</h4>
			<p>
				At Ryner Homes, we believe in being more than just the next green builder; we believe in going above and beyond the 
				norm to build the most energy-efficient homes in the country. Some home builders take a step in the right direction, 
				but stop there and call themselves green. We, on the other hand, decided to build custom homes differently, from the ground up.
			</p>
			<p>
				Building green means getting more performance from your home or building with less environmental impact compared to traditional 
				construction. You can build a healthy and efficient home to be proud of.
			</p>
			<h3>Why Design-Build?</h3>
			<p>
				Simply, this approach delivers faster, higher-quality and more cost-effective results.
			</p>
			<h4>What Are the Benefits?</h4>
			<p>
				A design-build contractor is responsible for the design, while simultaneously estimating construction costs. Decisions can be 
				made during the design of the project based on cost, rather than just on the design.
