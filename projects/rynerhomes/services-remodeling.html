			<h2>Remodelling | Renovations | Additions</h2>
			<p>
				Remodelling is a major investment for any property. If you're looking to update the design, appearance, and/or infrastructure of your home or business, trust the team at Ryner Homes as your general contractor to handle all aspects of your project. Our goal is to transform your home or business into the space you've always wanted.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				No matter the size or scope of your remodelling or renovation project, we want to make it an exciting and
				pleasant experience, not stressful. Because we are not a spec builder and we only do custom and referral
				based projects, we can take the time to understand your needs and work to come up with creative, cost effective
				solutions for transforming your home.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				When you work with Ryner Homes on a remodelling project, you will have a world of options available to
				you. From our 20 plus years of experience as a design build company to our in-house design team and our
				virtual 3D CAD design programs that can virtually walk you through your new home before we even start
				construction. So if you have been dreaming of that smaller renovation like a new kitchen, bathroom, or a
				new four season outdoor living space we can help. And if you are look at larger projects like Mother-in law
				attached and detached apartments or complete home and business remodels our skilled staff and years
				of experience can handle it all.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				The Ryner Homes look is marked by a mixture of elements like stone and brick, natural woods, lush
				landscaping, beautiful design and overall quality. Ryner Homes builds for longevity- believing that a home
				should be more than the sum of its parts- and is a structure that securely contains and shapes your
				family's life. This extraordinary combination has proven successful for our company. Eric, the owner of
				Ryner Homes, understands the importance of a solid structure around the people you love. See some
				examples of our work to get an idea of what we can do for you.
